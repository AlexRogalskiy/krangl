# Module krangl

`krangl` is a {K}otlin library for data w{rangl}ing. By implementing a grammar of data manipulation using a modern functional-style API, it allows to filter, transform aggregate and reshape tabular data.

For details see [https://github.com/holgerbrandl/krangl](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/krangl)

## Features

* Filter, transform, aggregate and reshape tabular data
* Modern, user-friendly and easy-to-learn data-science API
* Reads from plain and compressed tsv, csv, or any delimited format with or without header from local or remote
* Supports grouped operations
* Ships with JDBC support
* Tables can contain atomic columns (int, double, boolean) as well as object columns
* Reshape tables from wide to long and back
* Table joins (left, right, semi, inner, outer)
* Cross tabulation
* Descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, median, ...)
* Functional API inspired by [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and Kotlin [stdlib](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/index.html)
