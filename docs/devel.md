## Design

## Gradle

create fresh gradle wrapper with:

`gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.2.1`

From https://github.com/twosigma/beakerx/issues/5135: Split repos?
> It is a bad idea. Many different repos are hard to maintain. And you do not need this. Gradle allows to publish separate artifacts without splitting repository.  
you can use `gradle :kernel:base:<whatever>` instead of `cd`.




# Reading Log & Misc


From spark release notes:
> Unifying DataFrames and Datasets in Scala/Java: Starting in Spark 2.0, DataFrame is just a type alias for Dataset of Row. Both the typed methods (e.g. map, filter, groupByKey) and the untyped methods (e.g. select, groupBy) are available on the Dataset class. Also, this new combined Dataset interface is the abstraction used for Structured Streaming. Since compile-time type-safety in Python and R is not a language feature, the concept of Dataset does not apply to these languagesâ€™ APIs. Instead, DataFrame remains the primary programing abstraction, which is analogous to the single-node data frame notion in these languages. Get a peek from a Dataset API notebook.

To Improve JVM compatibility use JvmName to allow for more strongly typed

```kotlin
@JvmName("mutateString")
fun DataFrame.mutate(name: String, formula: (DataFrame) -> List<String>): DataFrame {
    if(this is SimpleDataFrame){
        return addColumn(StringCol(name, formula(this)))
    }else
        throw UnsupportedOperationException()
}

```


## incorrect usage patterns

* `sleepData.sortedBy{ "order" }`

unclear fix except for requiring vectorized result for SortExpression
